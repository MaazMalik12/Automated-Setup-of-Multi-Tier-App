# Automated-Setup-of-Multi-Tier-Appsetting up a scalable and robust web application
infrastructure using technologies such as Vagrant,
RabbitMQ, Tomcat, and Nginx.
In this project, I utilized Vagrant to create a virtualized
environment consisting of multiple virtual machines
(VMS) for different components of the application
stack. The VMs were provisioned with CentOS, and 1
implemented the necessary networking and
configuration to ensure smooth communication
between the components.
For message queuing and asynchronous"
communication, I integrated RabbitMQ, a reliable and
scalable message broker. By configuring RabbitMQ, I
enabled efficient and decoupled communication
between different parts of the application.
To handle the web application's backend logic, I set
up Tomcat, a popular Java-based web server. By
configuring Tomcat and deploying the application
code, I ensured that the backend services were
running efficiently and reliably.
To provide load balancing and reverse proxy
capabilities, I integrated Nginx, a high-performance
web server. By configuring Nginx, I ensured that
incoming client requests were effi iently distributed
among multiple backend servers, improving the
application's performance and reliability.
Throughout the project, I focused on automation,
security, and scalability, ensuring that the
infrastructure could handle increased traffic and
provide a seamless user experience,

honing my skills in infrastructure setup, configuration
management, and networking
